# ParkIt
Every BYU student that drives to campus knows the agony of trying to find parking. There are so few spots that it seems like all the lots are full by 9:00 AM. It's hard to find which lots might still have an open space or two, especially when you're in a hurry. To add insult to injury, the BYU parking app doesn't even list all the lots. Because of this, many students mistakenly (or on purpose) park illegaly, risking parking tickets.
