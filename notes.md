- It's easiest to just use the GitHub lens in VS Code, since it lets you compare both versions. 
- Github README files use markdown in their formattingâ€”just like discord!
- make sure you pull before starting to make changes, otherwise you won't be working with the most up-to-date version.
- Make sure you push frequently, so you don't worry so much about losing your work.
