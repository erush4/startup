            <p>BYU ParkIt is an open source project with the goal of streamlining the process
                of parking at BYU. The goal is to create a website that allows students to report
                an approximate number of available parking spots nearby, then display these reports
                in such a way that it is easier for students to know where they should try to park.
                This is very much a work in progress; since this is for my CS 260 class, it should be 
                at least functional by the end of the year (2024). If you see any bugs, feel free to
                report them on github.
